        <h4>Wet Pipe Sprinkler System</h4>
        <img style="height: 150px;" src="assets/images/wet-pipe-system.jpg" alt="Wet pipe system">
        <p style="text-align: left;">Wet systems are the most common and reliable sprinkler systems. Since no equipment other than the sprinkler heads are required to operate, this makes them a very reliable and low maintenance sprinkler system. Wet systems use automatic sprinkler heads. These heads are attached to piping containing water, which are connected to a water supply. This allows water to be discharged immediately from an open sprinkler. Water will only be discharged through heads that have opened due to fire. There are two basic types of wet systems. We work with both and based on the customers need and the specifications of the building they are being installed into we will recommend either the Straight Pipe Riser or the Wet System with an Alarm Check Valve.</p>

        <h4>Dry Pipe Sprinkler System</h4>
        <img style="height: 150px;" src="assets/images/dry-pipe-manifold-system.jpg" alt="Dry pipe system manifold">
        <p style="text-align: left;">Dry pipe systems are typically installed in unheated buildings or where there is the danger of sprinkler pipes freezing. This particular system uses automatic sprinklers attached to a piping system pressurized with air. These systems hold back the water supply using a dry pipe valve and air pressure. Once the air pressure within the system bleeds off due to an open sprinkler, the water pressure will open the valve and fill the system. Water is only discharged through open heads due to a fire.</p>

        <h4>Pre-Action System</h4>
        <img style="height: 150px;" src="assets/images/Pre-Pack-Pre-Action-Systems.webp" alt="Pre-Pack-Pre-Action-Systems">
        <p  style="text-align: left;">There are two kinds of pre-action systems. Single Interlock Systems and Double Interlock Systems. Pre-Action systems are very similar to dry pipe systems, except instead of a dry pipe valve to hold back the water supply they use an electrically operated valve. Unlike conventional dry pipe systems, they are designed to overcome the operational delay, and also eliminate the possibility of water damage cause by accidental damage to the sprinkler heads or system piping. After a thorough walk through with our clients and custom design solution, we will determine what style of pre-action system is best for your building.</p>
